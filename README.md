# Introduction

This is a super basic utility script for decoding filenames of csvs that have been saved or downloaded with url encoded filenames. 

Simply put the file(s) that need to be renamed in the "todo" folder and run the script. The renamed file will be in the "done" folder. 

The repo includes an example file called "my%20-%20example%20%282022-08%29.csv" in the todo folder that will be renamed to "my - example (2022-08).csv"
